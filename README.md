Predict the Attrition of the Employees and the factors responsible for attrition.
Attrition is a problem that impacts all businesses, irrespective of geography, industry and size of the company. Employee attrition leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff and training new staff. As such, there is great business interest in understanding the drivers of, and minimizing staff attrition.

This data set presents an employee survey from IBM, indicating if there is attrition or not. The data set contains approximately 24000 entries. Given the limited size of the data set, the model should only be expected to provide modest improvement in indentification of attrition vs a random allocation of probability of attrition.

While some level of attrition in a company is inevitable, minimizing it and being prepared for the cases that cannot be helped will significantly help improve the operations of most businesses. As a future development, with a sufficiently large data set, it would be used to run a segmentation on employees, to develop certain “at risk” categories of employees. This could generate new insights for the business on what drives attrition, insights that cannot be generated by merely informational interviews with employees.
